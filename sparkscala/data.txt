One important parameter for parallel collections is the number of partitions to cut the dataset into. Spark will run one task for each partition of the cluster. Typically you want 2-4 partitions for each CPU in your cluster. Normally, Spark tries to set the number of partitions automatically based on your cluster. However, you can also set it manually by passing it as a second parameter to parallelize (e.g. sc.parallelize(data, 10)). Note: some places in the code use the term slices (a synonym for partitions) to maintain backward compatibility
